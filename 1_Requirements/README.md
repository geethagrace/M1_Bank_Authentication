# Introduction:
In our daily life authentication plays a vital role. Authentication enables organizations to keep their networks secure by permitting only authenticated users or processes to gain access to their protected resources. This may include computer systems, networks, databases, websites and other network-based applications or services.  

# Features:
1. It is a prerequisite for introduction of any protection system.

2. Available everywere for security purposes.

3. By use of file handling data can be stored safely.

# 4W'S and 1H:
## What?
* It is an authentication system using file handling. It can create an entry and used for login. If the login creddentials are correct then authentication will be successful and you can futher access by checking balance , withraw or deposit amount . On the other hand if login fails, it wont't allow to access further.
## WHY?
* Its important to keep unauthorized users from accessing sensitive information.Authentication helps ensure only authorized users can gain access to a system by preventing unauthorized users from gaining access and potentially damaging systems, stealing information or causing other problems..
## WHERE?
* Authentication is used where concerned user needs to know exactly who is accessing their information or site.In this project it is used for banking application.
## WHO?
*  It is an authentication system which allows further for only valid login credentials.
## HOW?
*  Authentication which is the main part of this project and if login details are valid then it can be accessed further for more information.

# SWOT ANALYSIS:
## Strength:
- It adds more security.
- Simple to deploy.
- Prevents unauthorized access.
## Weakness:
- Regular renewal to keep the security due to deterministic fumction of storing password.
## Opportunity:
- We should create an opportunity to make people know more about authentication and how to secure data by simple authentication system .
## Threat:
- Now there are many new developing passwordless authentication.
